## Key Ideas

::: incremental
-   Allow for staggered adoption

-   Reduce interpolation

-   Account for exposed series outside of the convex hull

-   Incorporate control series on different outcomes/scales from treated series
:::

## Motivating Example

We saw in the previous example that multiple states initiated lotteries at different times.

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
load("../data/lottery_lang.Rda")
```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Plot of percent fully vaccinated rates by U.S. state, Jan.-Sept. 2021"
#| fig-alt: "Line plot with several Other Lottery States and Non-Lottery States, as well as three focused states: Ohio, New Mexico, and Maine. Maine is in the middle of the set of lines, while New Mexico is among the highest early on, and Maine is among the highest in May/June."
ggplot(data=lang_0624,
       mapping=aes(group=state, linetype=type2, color=type2,
                   alpha=type2, linewidth=type2,
                   x=last_day,y=people_fully_vaccinated_per_hundred)) +
  scale_alpha_manual(name=NULL, breaks=c("Ohio","New Mexico","Maine",
                                         "Other Lottery State",
                                         "Non-Lottery State"),
                     values=c(1,1,1,0.5,0.8)) + 
  scale_linewidth_manual(name=NULL, breaks=c("Ohio","New Mexico","Maine",
                                         "Other Lottery State",
                                         "Non-Lottery State"),
                         values=c(1.3,1.3,1.3,1,1)) +
  geom_line() + theme_bw() +
  geom_vline(data=lang_0624 %>% 
               dplyr::filter(type2 %in% c("Ohio","New Mexico","Maine"),
                                              rel_week==0),
             mapping=aes(xintercept=lott_date, group=type2, color=type2),
             linetype="dotted") +
  labs(x="Day (2021)", y="Percent Fully Vaccinated",
       linetype=NULL,color=NULL)
```

# Methods

## Standard SCM

The standard SCM had weights $w_i$ that minimized:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^K v_k \left( X_{1k} - \left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_{0ik} w_i \right) \right)^2,
$$

for covariates $k=1,\ldots,K$.

## General: Penalized SCM

This can be extended with a penalty term $\xi$ on a function of the weights $f(w_i)$ to minimize:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^K v_k \left( X_{1k} - \left(\sum_{i=1}^n X_{0ik} w_i \right) \right)^2 + \xi \sum_{i=1}^n f(w_i).
$$

The penalty can reduce interpolation (force closer matches to specific units) or reduce discrepancy from an outcome model.

## De-Meaned SCM

[![](images/Adv_SC/Ferman2021cite.png){fig-alt="Title for Ferman and Pinto (2021)" fig-align="center" width="817"}](https://doi.org/10.3982/QE1596)

## De-Meaned SCM

::: callout-note
## Idea

De-mean the pre-treatment data, fit SC to the de-meaned observations, and apply the weights to both the post-treatment time trends and levels.

Incorporates idea of diff-in-diff of focusing on matching trends instead of levels.
:::

. . .

::: callout-warning
Matching pre-treatment trends may not lead to stable weights going forward.

Different interpretation of weights.

## Synthetic DID

[![](images/Adv_SC/Arkhangelsky2021cite.png){fig-alt="Title for Arkhangelsky et al. (2021)" fig-align="center"}](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20190159)

## SDID: Procedure

::: callout-note
## Idea

Incorporate unit weighting of SC with unit fixed effects of DID and time weighting. "Localized" TWFE model.
:::

::: incremental
1.  Compute regularization parameter
2.  Compute regularized, intercept-adjusted/de-meaned SC weights
3.  Compute time weights
4.  Conduct weighted TWFE regression
:::

## Augmented Synthetic Control

[![](images/Adv_SC/BM2021-1cite.png){fig-alt="Title of Ben-Michael et al. (2021)" fig-align="center" width="836"}](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2021.1929245)

. . .

::: callout-note
## Idea

De-bias SC estimate using an outcome model for the time series.
:::

## Ridge-Adjusted ASCM: Procedure

::: incremental
1.  Compute SC weights
2.  Fit outcome model (i.e., ridge regression) to control data (post-treatment outcomes \~ pre-treatment outcomes)
3.  Get model estimates for all units' post-treatment outcomes
4.  Find discrepancy between model estimate for treated unit and model estimate for synthetic unit (weighted avg of model estimates for control units)
5.  Add this difference to SC estimator
:::

## ASCM: Additional Details

::: incremental
-   If pre-treatment fit is good, discrepancy will be small and adjustment will have little effect

-   Allows for level shift by capturing a consistent discrepancy

-   Can still express as weights of control units, but negative weights now allowed; penalizes discrepancy from SC weights
:::

## ASCM: Multiple Periods

[![](images/Adv_SC/BM2021-2cite.png){fig-alt="Title of Ben-Michael et al., (2022)" fig-align="center"}](https://doi.org/10.1111/rssb.12448)

Options:

-   Fit separate SCM for each unit

-   Fit SCM on average of treated units

-   Partially pooled SCM: mix of both

-   With intercepts, similar trade-offs to weighted DID approaches

## SDID and ASCM: Summary

[![](images/Adv_SC/Krajewski2024cite.png){fig-alt="Title for Krajewski and Hudgens (2024)" fig-align="center" width="798"}](https://doi.org/10.1177/09622802231224638)

. . .

Advantages:

-   Allow intercept shift
-   Allow negative weights with some sparsity
-   Improved performance in settings with poor SC fit

Disadvantages:

-   Allow extrapolation
-   Loss of interpretation of weights
-   More user degrees of freedom
-   Challenging inference

## Generalized Synthetic Control

::: callout-note
## Idea: "Interactive Fixed Effects"

Use control unit data to estimate unit fixed effects and some set of unknown time-varying coefficients (factors).

Use these coefficients to estimate treated unit fixed effects.

Use the treated unit FEs and time-varying effects to estimate counterfactuals for treated unit-periods.
:::

## Matrix Completion

-   Similar to interactive fixed effects

-   Uses a continuous penalty instead of a sparsity-inducing penalty on the unknown time-varying coefficients.

## GSC, IFE, and Matrix Completion

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Advantages:**

-   Can achieve better fit

-   Accomodates staggered adoption and general time-varying treatment

-   Allows quick and efficient estimation for multiple treated units
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Disadvantages/Assumptions:**

-   Requires a fixed (but unknown) set of time-varying factors across time and units

-   Number of factors usually selected by cross-validation

-   Allows extrapolation and loses strict weighting interpretability

## Bayesian Structural Time Series Modeling

:::: callout-note
## Idea

Combine three information sources in state-time model:

::: incremental
-   Bayesian priors on covariate importance
-   Time series modeling of outcome pre-intervention
-   State-space model for treated unit based on controls
:::

## BSTS: Summary

# Tradeoffs and Interpretations

## Validity: Interpolation vs. Extrapolation

::: incremental
-   Pooling across units enables better fit, but loses unit-specific information

-   Extrapolation allows better pre-treatment fit, but may over-fit or rely on additional assumptions

-   Reducing interpolation is crucial for some settings (non-linear outcomes)
:::

## Generalizability-Bias-Variance Tradeoffs

::: incremental
-   Advanced methods allow use of more control series: reduces variance but may introduce bias

-   Cross-validation procedures can improve fit but reduce efficiency

-   Accounting for heterogeneities improves generalizability and reduces bias but increases variance

-   Still require common factors, exogenous shocks, no intervening treatments
:::

## Interpretability of Weights

::: incremental
-   A key benefit of SC is its interpretability

-   This is somewhat lost in more advanced approaches

-   The interpretability is tied to justifying the assumptions as well
