:::::

::: incremental
-   Allows use of routinely-collected data

-   Evaluates interventions in-context

-   Provides "real world evidence"/population impact

-   Answers questions randomized trials and observational studies cannot

-   But ... has threats to internal and external validity
:::

## Threats and Considerations

::: incremental
-   Exchangeability conditions phrased differently

-   Requires other assumptions, which are sometimes "hidden" or opaque

-   Trade-offs between bias, variance, and generalizability

-   Need to carefully consider desired estimand (ATT vs. others)

-   Rarely includes sample size/power justification

-   Gain familiarity with state-of-the-art methods related to DID and SC and identify resources for further exploration

-   Contextualize the assumptions needed for causal inference from quasi-experiments

-   Implement staggered adoption DID and SC analyses and diagnostics/inference in `R`

## A Note on the Examples

I will focus here on infectious disease examples from published literature with available data. Some issues are specific to ID, while others are not, but they illustrate the points of how to approach these questions.

# Epidemiologic Considerations for DID

## Key Assumptions

::: incremental
-   Parallel trends (in expectation of potential outcomes)

-   No spillover

-   No anticipation/clear time point for treatment
:::

## Methods to Improve Assumptions

::: incremental
-   Re-scale the outcome

-   Incorporate covariates

-   Include more or fewer units and/or time periods
:::

## ATT Estimand

::: callout-important
## Estimand Interpretation

DID estimates the **Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)**.

This may not be generalizable to other units, including the untreated units in the study.
:::

## Internal vs. External Validity

-   Internal validity may be high if the assumptions are justified.

-   External validity may be low because of limited transportability of the ATT and limited information on effect heterogeneity.

## Bias vs. Variance

-   Incorporating additional units/periods can reduce variance, but may also risk violating the assumptions

-   Generally conducted with limited, carefully-selected units: low bias but high variance

. . .

::: callout-note
## Examples

-   More distant vs. closer untreated units

-   Incorporating more untreated units

-   Incorporating more recent time periods
:::

## Summary: DID for Epidemiology

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Advantages:

-   Simple to implement

-   Uses summary data

-   No need to model time trends or collect covariates

-   Straightforward interpretation
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Disadvantages/Limitations:

-   Targets ATT not ATE

-   Need to justify key assumptions

-   Requires careful selection of controls

-   Limited inference with few units/periods
